I thought that someone told that we will use -i18n list for these
purposes... am I right?

I know that this is very important to reach as many translators as
possible, but I don't want private mails!

I have some SMS sending procmail scripts and daily limit for SMSes from
net. So please do not send me private mails... I read l10n & i18n lists
so I can check what's new there. I can also check it on seppy's webpage,
so I really don't need any additional info.

   It's an off-topic rant, so I discard it.
